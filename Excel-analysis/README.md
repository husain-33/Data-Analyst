Brief Description â€“ Sales Data Analysis Project
This Excel project presents a Sales Data Analysis that involves tracking and interpreting various sales-related parameters such as:

I have also implemented key analytical tasks such as:

Summarizing Sales by Product using Excel functions (e.g., SUMIF)
Data Sorting & Filtering for clear insights
Potential Time-Based Trend Identification (e.g., month-wise or seasonal analysis)
Basic restructuring and formatting for readability
